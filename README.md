# Game of Life Simulator
Console version only Game of Life working.
Canvas grid semi-functional.

Done'd:
- reduce blurriness of lines of the canvas (suspected culprit is that the canvas dimensions are being scaled to fit something)
- make cells line up with with canvas better.
- connect renderer to the game.

WIP:
- Rewrite GoL to produce a set of changes to make instead of returning a set of live cells.
